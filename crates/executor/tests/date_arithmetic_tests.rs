//! Tests for date arithmetic functions (DATEDIFF, DATE_ADD, DATE_SUB, EXTRACT, AGE)
//!
//! This test suite is organized into focused sub-modules for better organization:
//! - date_operations: DATEDIFF, DATE_ADD, DATE_SUB with DATE types
//! - time_operations: Time-specific calculations (HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND)
//! - timestamp_operations: Timestamp with time component operations
//! - interval_operations: EXTRACT and AGE functions
//! - edge_cases: Leap years, month/year boundaries, null handling, errors

// Re-export common test utilities
