//! - `builder` - Struct definition and constructor methods
//! - `execute` - Main execution entry points
//! - `columns` - Column name derivation
//! - `aggregation` - Aggregation and GROUP BY execution
//! - `nonagg` - Non-aggregation execution path
//! - `utils` - Utility methods for expression analysis
