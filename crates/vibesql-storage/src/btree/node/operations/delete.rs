//! Delete operations for BTreeIndex
//!
//! This module contains deletion logic for removing keys and row IDs from the B+ tree.

use super::super::structure::{Key, RowId};
use super::super::btree_index::BTreeIndex;

impl BTreeIndex {
    /// Delete all row IDs for a key from the B+ tree
    ///
    /// For non-unique indexes, this removes the key and **all** associated row IDs
    /// in a single operation. If you need to remove only specific row IDs while
    /// keeping others, you must implement that logic at a higher level.
    ///
    /// Implements full multi-level tree deletion with node merging and rebalancing.
    /// When a deletion causes a leaf node to become underfull, it will try to borrow
    /// entries from sibling nodes or merge with a sibling if borrowing isn't possible.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `key` - The key to delete (removes all associated row_ids)
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(true)` if the key was found and deleted (all row IDs removed)
    /// * `Ok(false)` if the key was not found
    /// * `Err(_)` if an I/O error occurred
    ///
    /// # Performance
    /// - O(log n) to find key + O(log n) for potential rebalancing
    /// - All row IDs for the key are removed regardless of count
    ///
    /// # Example
    /// ```ignore
    /// use vibesql_types::SqlValue;
    ///
    /// // Insert duplicate keys
    /// index.insert(vec![SqlValue::Integer(42)], 1)?;
    /// index.insert(vec![SqlValue::Integer(42)], 2)?;
    /// index.insert(vec![SqlValue::Integer(42)], 3)?;
    ///
    /// // Delete removes ALL row IDs for key 42
    /// let deleted = index.delete(&vec![SqlValue::Integer(42)])?;
    /// assert!(deleted); // true - key was found and removed
    ///
    /// // Subsequent lookup returns empty
    /// let rows = index.lookup(&vec![SqlValue::Integer(42)])?;
    /// assert!(rows.is_empty());
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Algorithm
    /// 1. Find the leaf node containing the key
    /// 2. Delete all row_ids for the key from the leaf (single operation)
    /// 3. If leaf becomes underfull, try to borrow from sibling or merge
    /// 4. Propagate rebalancing up the tree if necessary
    /// 5. Collapse the root if it has only one child
