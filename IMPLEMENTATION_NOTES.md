# Implementation Notes for Issue #276

## Completed Work

### 1. Database Implementations (✅ Complete)
- **Employees Database**: Enhanced with first_name, last_name columns and 20 sample employees
  - Required for string examples (string-2, string-4, string-7)
  - Previously had only single "name" column
  
- **Company Database**: Already implemented with complete schema
  - departments (5 rows)
  - employees (20 rows)
  - projects (10 rows)
  
- **University Database**: Already implemented with comprehensive data
  - students (50 rows)
  - courses (20 rows)
  - enrollments (~80 rows with multiple semesters)
  - professors (10 rows)

### 2. Expected Results Added (✅ Partial)

**String Examples (3/3 - Complete)**
- string-2: String extraction with SUBSTRING and LENGTH
- string-4: String concatenation with || and CONCAT
- string-7: String search with POSITION

**Company Examples (5/5 - Complete)**
- company-1: Department headcount and salary statistics
- company-2: Project budgets by department
- company-3: Employee project assignments
- company-4: Budget efficiency analysis
- company-5: High-value projects report

**University Examples (1/6 - Partial)**
- uni-4: Grade distribution ✅
- uni-1, uni-2, uni-3, uni-5, uni-6: **TODO** - Require actual query execution to validate

**DDL Examples (0/12 - TODO)**
- Need special handling (DDL doesn't return rows like SELECT)
- Approach: Test for successful execution rather than result rows

**DML Examples (0/10 - TODO)**
- Need special handling (DML returns affected row counts)
- Approach: Test for "X rows affected" or validate state after execution

## Remaining Work

### University Examples (5 remaining)
The following examples involve complex correlated subqueries or extensive cross-joins that are difficult to calculate manually. They should be validated by executing the queries:

1. **uni-1**: Student GPA Calculation (correlated subquery with CASE)
2. **uni-2**: Course Enrollment Statistics (LEFT JOIN with COUNT)
3. **uni-3**: Department Analysis (multi-table JOIN with COUNT DISTINCT)
4. **uni-5**: High-Performing Students (correlated subquery comparing to major average)
5. **uni-6**: Courses with No Enrollments (LEFT JOIN with NULL filter)

### DDL & DML Examples
These require a different testing approach since they don't return result sets like SELECT:

**DDL (12 examples)**
- Examples: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, constraints
- Expected behavior: Successful execution without errors
- Test approach: Verify no exceptions thrown, table exists after

**DML (10 examples)**
- Examples: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE
- Expected behavior: "X rows affected" messages
- Test approach: Verify affected row count matches expected

## Testing Approach

To complete the remaining work:

1. **Run queries in web demo**: Execute each query and capture actual results
2. **Validate results**: Ensure results match the sample data
3. **Add EXPECTED blocks**: Format results as SQL comments
4. **Create test infrastructure**: Build Rust test parser (if not already exists)

## Notes on Calculations

For reference, some calculations were complex due to cross-joins:
- **company-4**: Employee-project cross product inflates both COUNT and SUM by same factor
  - Engineering: 5 employees × 3 projects = 15 rows, budget summed 5 times
- **company-3**: Each employee paired with every project in their department
  - Results in multiple rows per employee (one per project)
