## Major Lessons (So Far)

### Planning Phase (Week 1)

#### Lesson 1: Clarify Requirements Early

**What happened**: We opened 7 GitHub issues asking for clarification on the problem statement.

**Why it mattered**: The original spec was ambiguous (which SQL version? what level of compliance? which test suite?).

**Outcome**: Got clear answers from upstream - SQL:1999, FULL compliance, both ODBC and JDBC required.

**Takeaway**: Always clarify ambiguous requirements before diving into implementation. Don't make assumptions.

**Apply to**: Any new feature or requirement - ask questions first.

#### Lesson 2: No Official NIST SQL:1999 Test Suite Exists

**Discovery**: NIST SQL Test Suite Version 6.0 only covers SQL-92, not SQL:1999.

**Impact**: Must build our own comprehensive test suite.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach - sqllogictest (7M+ tests) for baseline + custom SQL:1999 feature tests.

**Takeaway**: Don't assume test infrastructure exists for old standards. Verify availability early.

#### Lesson 3: Document Everything from Day One

**Decision**: Created comprehensive docs/ structure before writing any code.

**Rationale**: This is an unprecedented challenge with complex requirements. Good documentation is essential.

**Benefit**: Clear templates, decision records, and learning logs will help throughout the project.

**Takeaway**: Documentation infrastructure is as important as code infrastructure for complex projects.

#### Lesson 4: The Scope Is Larger Than Initially Apparent

**Initial thought**: "SQL database" sounds like a well-defined problem.

**Reality**:
- SQL:1999 standard is 2000+ pages
- FULL compliance includes rarely-implemented optional features
- Need both ODBC and JDBC drivers
- Estimated 92,000-152,000 lines of code

**Implication**: This is a multi-year project, not a multi-week project.

**Takeaway**: Do thorough research to understand true scope before committing to timelines.

#### Lesson 5: Free Resources Are Available

**Discovery**:
- Complete SQL:1999 BNF grammar freely available
- "SQL-99 Complete, Really" book free online (covers Core SQL:1999)
- sqllogictest provides millions of test cases
- PostgreSQL source code as reference
- Mimer SQL validator for checking syntax

**Value**: Don't need to buy expensive ISO specs immediately; can start with free resources.

**Takeaway**: Research what's freely available before purchasing specifications.

## SQL:1999 Insights

### Three-Valued Logic Is Everywhere

SQL uses three-valued logic (TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN), not boolean logic. This affects:
- NULL comparisons: `NULL = NULL` is UNKNOWN, not TRUE
- WHERE clauses: Only TRUE rows are returned, not UNKNOWN
- Boolean operations: `TRUE OR UNKNOWN` is TRUE, but `FALSE AND UNKNOWN` is UNKNOWN

**Reference**: SQL:1999 Part 2, Section 4.4 - "The Boolean type"

### IS vs = for Boolean Comparisons

**Common mistake**: `WHERE bool_column = TRUE`

**Correct**: `WHERE bool_column IS TRUE`

**Why**: The `=` operator returns UNKNOWN for NULL values, while IS handles them correctly.

### Recursive Queries Are Complex

SQL:1999 added WITH RECURSIVE for hierarchical queries. Implementation requires:
- Cycle detection
- Termination guarantees
- Efficient evaluation strategies
- UNION vs UNION ALL semantics

This is more complex than it initially appears.

## Technical Insights

### Parser Complexity

SQL is not context-free - it's context-sensitive. Examples:
- Keywords can be identifiers in some contexts
- Type names can be table names
- Ambiguity between function calls and column references

**Implication**: Simple parser generators may not be sufficient.

### ODBC/JDBC Are Not Simple Wrappers

Initially thought: "Just expose our SQL engine through standard APIs"

Reality:
- ODBC: Complex C state machine with connection pooling, cursor management
- JDBC: Requires Java implementation or complex JNI bindings
- Both protocols have extensive specifications

**Implication**: Protocol implementation is a major project component, not an afterthought.

## Tools and Resources

### Valuable Tools Discovered

1. **sqllogictest-rs**: Rust implementation of SQLLogicTest (7M+ test cases)
2. **ANTLR**: Parser generator with existing SQL grammars
3. **Mimer SQL Validator**: Online SQL:1999 syntax checker
4. **PostgreSQL source**: Excellent reference implementation

### Recommended Reading

1. "SQL-99 Complete, Really" by Gulutzan & Pelzer (free at crate.io)
2. "SQL:1999 Understanding Relational Language Components" by Melton & Simon
3. PostgreSQL documentation (excellent SQL reference)
4. Modern-SQL.com (SQL standard features explained)

## Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Assume Simple = Easy

**Mistake**: Thinking "it's just SQL" means it's straightforward.

**Reality**: SQL is complex, ambiguous, and full of edge cases.

**Prevention**: Respect the complexity; plan accordingly.

### Don't Skip Research Phase

**Temptation**: Jump straight to coding.

**Problem**: Without understanding requirements and scope, will hit blockers.

**Better approach**: Spend time upfront researching, planning, documenting.

### Don't Underestimate Testing

**Reality**: Testing a database requires:
- Millions of test cases
- Dual-protocol execution (ODBC and JDBC)
- Edge case coverage
- Compliance validation

**Implication**: Test infrastructure is as large as the implementation itself.

## Open Questions

### Question 1: Should We Target SQL-92 First?

**Context**: SQL:1999 is a superset of SQL-92. Should we implement SQL-92 completely, then add SQL:1999 features?

**Pros**: Incremental approach, can use NIST SQL-92 tests

**Cons**: More work overall, may need to refactor for SQL:1999 features

**Status**: To be decided in ADR-0002

### Question 2: How to Handle Implementation-Defined Behavior?

**Context**: SQL:1999 has many "implementation-defined" aspects where databases can choose.

**Question**: How do we make these decisions? Match PostgreSQL? Define our own?

**Status**: Document as we encounter them

## Recent Development Lessons (October 2025)

### LIMIT/OFFSET Implementation (TDD Cycle)

**Context**: Added pagination support to SELECT queries (PR #4, commit 88495a1)

**Lessons**:
- TDD approach allowed incremental feature building without breaking existing functionality
- LIMIT and OFFSET are simpler than they appear - just array slicing after query execution
- Testing edge cases (LIMIT > result set, OFFSET beyond end) caught important bugs early
- SQL:1999 spec allows LIMIT 0 and OFFSET 0 (not errors, just return empty/full results)

**Key Insights**:
- Pagination is a post-processing step, not part of core query execution
- Edge case tests are as important as happy path tests
- Small, focused commits make it easier to track when bugs were introduced

**Would Do Differently**: Nothing - this was a smooth implementation using established TDD patterns

### Parser and Module Refactoring

**Context**: Split monolithic parser.rs, catalog.rs, and executor modules (commits de9f019, and issues #12, #13, #14)

**Lessons**:
- Large files (600+ lines) become hard to navigate and maintain
- Module organization by responsibility (lexer, AST nodes, expression types) improves code clarity
- Rust's module system encourages good separation of concerns
- Breaking changes across multiple files is easier when modules are well-organized

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Moving code between files requires careful attention to visibility (`pub`, `pub(crate)`)
- Test organization needs to mirror module structure
- Some circular dependencies emerged during refactoring (resolved with better layering)

**Key Insights for Future SQL Features**:
- Keep each module under 200-300 lines when possible
- Group related functionality together (all SELECT parsing in one module)
- Use directories with `mod.rs` for complex features (e.g., `executor/select/`)

### Loom Orchestration Framework Integration

**Context**: Integrated AI-powered development orchestration system (v0.1.0, commit 050b0c5)

**Lessons**:
- Label-based workflows enable autonomous agent coordination without direct communication
- Curator/Builder/Judge/Architect roles create clear separation of responsibilities
- Git worktrees allow multiple agents to work on different issues simultaneously
- GitHub labels become the state machine for development workflow

**Benefits**:
- Issues get enhanced with technical context automatically (Curator role)
- PRs get reviewed systematically (Judge role)
- Architectural proposals are generated based on codebase analysis (Architect role)
- Manual and autonomous modes provide flexibility

**Challenges**:
- Learning curve for label-based coordination initially
- Need to trust autonomous agents to follow role definitions
- Worktree management requires discipline (cleanup when done)

**Would Do Differently**: Nothing - Loom integration went smoothly and immediately improved workflow organization

### Coverage Infrastructure Setup

**Context**: Added cargo-llvm-cov for code coverage tracking (PR #8, commit fbbbab3)

**Lessons**:
- Baseline coverage: **188 tests, 83.3% coverage** established
- HTML reports (`cargo coverage`) provide visual feedback on untested code paths
- LCOV format (`cargo coverage-lcov`) enables integration with coverage tracking services
- Cargo aliases in `.cargo/config.toml` simplify complex commands for all contributors

**Implementation Insights**:
- `cargo-llvm-cov` is more accurate than `tarpaulin` for Rust coverage
- Coverage commands should be part of CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions
- Visual HTML reports help identify exactly which lines/branches are untested
- Coverage percentage is a metric, not a goal - focus on meaningful tests

**Gotchas Discovered**:
- Coverage report path is `target/coverage/html/html/index.html` (note nested `html/` directory)
- Need to run `cargo coverage-clean` before re-running to avoid stale instrumentation data
- Coverage adds compilation time - not for every local test run

**Future Improvements**:
- Set coverage baseline in CI (fail if coverage drops below 80%)
- Add coverage badges to README
- Track coverage trends over time
