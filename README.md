## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a **FULL SQL:1999 compliant** database from scratch, designed for NIST conformance testing. This is a research and educational project targeting complete standard compliance—something no production database has achieved.

### Two-Phase Strategy

**Phase 1: Core SQL:1999 Compliance** (Current Focus - AI Speed Run)
- Implement ~169 mandatory Core features
- Timeline: **~1-2 weeks** from start (Oct 25, 2025)
- Enables NIST Core testing
- Provides solid foundation

**Phase 2: FULL SQL:1999 Compliance** (Ultimate Goal)
- Implement all mandatory + optional features (400+)
- Timeline: A larger effort, but not years
- Unprecedented achievement
- Inspired by the [posix4e/nistmemsql challenge](https://github.com/posix4e/nistmemsql)

**Note**: PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server implement Core + selective optional features. This is an AI-powered "speed run" to demonstrate rapid standards compliance.

## 🤖 100% AI-Generated: The Vibe-Coded Database

**Does this README sound like it was written by AI? That's because it was.**

Every line of code, every test, every piece of documentation in this repository has been generated by AI agents using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and the [Loom orchestration framework](https://github.com/loomhq/loom). This is not AI-assisted development—this is **AI-primary development**.

**What we've built** (in ~1 week, Oct 25-31, 2025):
- 📊 **64,000+ lines** of production Rust code
- ✅ **2,000+ passing tests** with 86% coverage
- 🎯 **Near-complete SQL:1999 Core compliance** (see badge above)
- 🚀 **Full WASM compilation** with live browser demo
- 📝 **Complete documentation** (you're reading it)
- 🏗️ **90+ merged PRs** via AI Builder/Judge workflow
- 🔒 **Complete security model** with privilege enforcement

**The challenge**: Can AI build a NIST-compatible SQL database from scratch? The answer is becoming clear: **Yes, and faster than expected.**

This is "vibe coding" at scale—high-level intent translated directly into working, tested, standards-compliant software. No human wrote the Rust. No human wrote the tests. The AI did it all.

### 🐕 Dogfooding: SQLLogicTest Database Integration (NEW!)

**VibeSQL now stores its own test results in VibeSQL!** We've implemented a complete database-integrated workflow for SQLLogicTest, demonstrating real-world usage.

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# Run tests (database auto-updates)
./scripts/sqllogictest run --time 60

# Query results with SQL!
./scripts/sqllogictest query --preset failed-files
./scripts/sqllogictest query --preset by-category

# Custom queries
./scripts/sqllogictest query --query "
    SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM test_files
    WHERE status='FAIL' GROUP BY category
"
```

**Features**:
- 📊 **3 tables**: test_files, test_runs, test_results
- 🔍 **9 preset queries**: failed-files, by-category, progress, flaky-tests, etc.
- 📈 **Historical tracking**: Track pass rate over time with git commits
- 🎯 **Manual testing workflow**: Query your progress as you work through tests

**Documentation**:
- [Quick Start Guide](docs/sqllogictest/SQLLOGICTEST_QUICKSTART.md) - 30-second introduction
- [Complete Documentation](docs/sqllogictest/SQLLOGICTEST_DATABASE.md) - Architecture, schema, queries, workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
cargo coverage

# Run SQL:1999 conformance tests
cargo test --test sqltest_conformance -- --nocapture

# Run SQLLogicTest baseline verification
cargo test --test sqllogictest_basic

# Run comprehensive SQLLogicTest suite with 5-minute time budget
SQLLOGICTEST_TIME_BUDGET=300 cargo test --test sqllogictest_suite --release -- --nocapture
```

**SQLLogicTest Systematic Testing Strategy**: The suite contains ~5.9 million test cases across 623 files. We use a **systematic punchlist approach** to achieve 100% conformance:

- **Punchlist system**: Comprehensive tracking of all 623 test files by category and status
- **Manual testing**: Test files one at a time to identify and fix root causes
- **Badge updates**: Shows `{passed}✓ {failed}✗ {untested}? ({pass_rate}%)`
- **Progress tracking**: All results tracked in `target/sqllogictest_punchlist.json`

To test individual files and track progress:
```bash
# Test a specific file
./scripts/test_one_file.sh index/delete/10/slt_good_0.test

# Regenerate punchlist after fixes
python3 scripts/generate_punchlist.py

# View progress
cat target/sqllogictest_punchlist.csv
```

See [`docs/roadmaps/PUNCHLIST_100_CONFORMANCE.md`](docs/roadmaps/PUNCHLIST_100_CONFORMANCE.md) for the complete strategic guide.

### SQLLogicTest Conformance Punchlist

To systematically track progress toward 100% SQLLogicTest conformance, we've created a comprehensive punchlist system:

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# Read the strategic guide
cat docs/sqllogictest/QUICK_START.md

# View the full punchlist
cat target/sqllogictest_punchlist.csv

# Test a single file to understand the current failures
./scripts/test_one_file.sh index/delete/10/slt_good_0.test

# Refresh the punchlist after fixes
python3 scripts/generate_punchlist.py
```

## 💭 Backstory: The Inflection Point Challenge

### The Philosophical Debate

[@rjwalters](https://github.com/rjwalters) has been arguing that we've crossed the **inflection point** for terminal-based coding agents—that AI assistants like Claude Code are now capable of implementing complex software designs end-to-end, given appropriate guidance. See [Working with AI](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom/blob/main/docs/philosophy/working-with-ai.md) and [Where Are All the Projects?](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom/blob/main/docs/philosophy/where-are-all-the-projects.md) for the full philosophy.

[@posix4e](https://github.com/posix4e) was skeptical. The objections centered on **context window limitations**—the belief that current LLMs can't handle truly complex or large projects that require maintaining state across thousands of implementation decisions.

### The Challenge

Rather than endless debate, a challenge was proposed: **"Implement a NIST-compatible SQL database from scratch."**

This isn't a toy project. A fully SQL:1999 compliant database is a **massive undertaking**:
- LLM estimates suggest a solo human developer might need **3-5 years** for FULL spec compliance
- No production database has achieved complete SQL:1999 compliance
- It's complex enough to be a legitimate test of AI capabilities
- It's tedious enough that humans typically give up

**@rjwalters' Position**: Claude Code, with appropriate guidance and the [Loom orchestration framework](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom), can implement the **Core SQL:1999 spec in less than two weeks**—orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than a human expert.

### The Experiment

This repository is that experiment, documented in real-time:

**Current Results** (As of latest test run - Nov 1, 2025):
- ✅ **100% SQL:1999 Core Conformance ACHIEVED** (739/739 tests passing) 🎉
- ✅ **2,000+ unit/integration tests passing** (100%)
- ✅ **Phase 2 Performance Optimizations** - Hash join, expression optimization, memory optimization
- ✅ Complete query engine with JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, aggregates, window functions
- ✅ Full transaction support with SAVEPOINT, all constraints enforced
- ✅ **Complete security model** with privilege enforcement on all operations
- ✅ 50+ built-in functions (string, date/time, math)
- ✅ Live web demo running in browser via WASM

**The Open Question**: Can Claude Code achieve **FULL SQL:1999 compliance**—something no database has ever accomplished? That would require months more work, implementing ~400+ features including procedural SQL, triggers, advanced types, and the information schema.

**The Certain Thing**: Writing a SQL database is **incredibly tedious**. A human developer would burn out after a few weeks of implementing string padding rules and three-valued logic edge cases. Claude won't. It'll keep trying, keep testing, keep iterating—however long it takes.

### Why This Matters

This isn't just about databases. It's about understanding what's now possible with AI-assisted development:
- Can LLMs handle multi-month, complex engineering projects?
- Do context windows truly limit real-world capability?
- What's the productivity multiplier with proper tooling (Loom)?
- Where is the actual inflection point for AI-powered development?

**We're documenting everything**—the successes, the failures, the weird edge cases where Claude hallucinates test assertions, the surprising moments where it refactors better than expected. Win or lose, the data will be public.

**Follow along**: This README updates in real-time as the experiment progresses. Place your bets.

### Interactive SQL Shell

VibeSQL includes a full-featured command-line interface with multiple execution modes.

#### Installation & Basic Usage

```bash
# Build the CLI
cargo build --release -p cli

# Run in interactive mode (REPL)
cargo run -p cli

# Load existing database
cargo run -p cli -- --database mydb.sql

# Execute SQL from command line
cargo run -p cli -- --command "SELECT * FROM users"

# Execute SQL from file
cargo run -p cli -- --file queries.sql

# Execute SQL from stdin (pipe support)
echo "SELECT 1 + 1" | cargo run -p cli --

# Set output format
cargo run -p cli -- --format json --command "SELECT * FROM users"
```

#### Execution Modes

**1. Interactive REPL Mode (Default)**
```bash
vibesql> CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(50));
vibesql> INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');
vibesql> SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

**2. Command Execution Mode**
```bash
# Execute single SQL command
vibesql -c "SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables"

# With custom format
vibesql -c "SELECT * FROM users" --format json
```

**3. File Execution Mode**
```bash
# Run all SQL commands from file
vibesql -f init.sql

# With verbose output
vibesql -f migration.sql --verbose
```

**4. Stdin Mode**
```bash
# Pipe SQL from another command
cat queries.sql | vibesql

# Use in shell scripts
echo "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users" | vibesql --format csv
```

#### Meta-Commands

The CLI supports PostgreSQL-style meta-commands:

```bash
# Database introspection
\d                  # List all tables
\d users            # Describe table structure
\dt                 # List tables
\ds                 # List schemas
\di                 # List indexes
\du                 # List roles/users

# Output control
\f table            # Set output format to table (default)
\f json             # Set output format to JSON
\f csv              # Set output format to CSV
\f markdown         # Set output format to Markdown
\f html             # Set output format to HTML

# Data import/export
\copy users TO '/tmp/users.csv'         # Export table to CSV
\copy users TO '/tmp/users.json'        # Export table to JSON
\copy users FROM '/tmp/backup.csv'      # Import CSV data
\copy users FROM '/tmp/data.json'       # Import JSON data

# Database persistence
\save                      # Save to default location
\save mybackup.sql         # Save to specific file

# Utilities
\timing                    # Toggle query execution timing
\errors                    # Show recent error history
\h or \help               # Show help
\q or \quit               # Exit

# Examples
vibesql> \f json
Output format set to JSON

vibesql> SELECT * FROM users;
[{"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}]

vibesql> \timing
Timing is on

vibesql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM large_table;
(10000 rows)
Time: 23.456 ms
```

#### Output Formats

Five output formats are supported:

**Table (Default)** - Pretty-printed ASCII table

show_row_count = true

# History settings
[history]
enabled = true
file_path = "~/.vibesql_history"
max_entries = 1000

# Performance
[performance]
query_timeout_ms = 30000
```

See `.vibesqlrc.example` for a complete configuration template.

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development

We build using **strict TDD** (Red-Green-Refactor):

```rust
// 1. RED: Write failing test first
#[test]
fn test_between_predicate() {
    let sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65";
    let result = parser::parse(sql);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

// 2. GREEN: Implement just enough to pass
// 3. REFACTOR: Clean up while tests stay green
```

**Benefits Observed**:
- ✅ 700+ tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ 85% code coverage
- ✅ Zero warnings (compiler + clippy)
- ✅ Faster development (less debugging)
- ✅ Safe refactoring
- ✅ Tests as living documentation
- ✅ Loom orchestration enables parallel development
