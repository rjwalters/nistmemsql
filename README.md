## üéØ Project Vision

Build a **FULL SQL:1999 compliant** database from scratch, designed for NIST conformance testing. This is a research and educational project targeting complete standard compliance‚Äîsomething no production database has achieved.

### Two-Phase Strategy

**Phase 1: Core SQL:1999 Compliance** (Current Focus - AI Speed Run)
- Implement ~169 mandatory Core features
- Timeline: **~1 week** from start (Oct 25, 2025)
- Enables NIST Core testing
- Provides solid foundation

**Phase 2: FULL SQL:1999 Compliance** (Ultimate Goal)
- Implement all mandatory + optional features (400+)
- Timeline: A larger effort, but not years
- Unprecedented achievement
- Aligns with [upstream posix4e/nistmemsql](https://github.com/posix4e/nistmemsql) vision

**Note**: PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server implement Core + selective optional features. This is an AI-powered "speed run" to demonstrate rapid standards compliance.

## üìä Current Status (October 27, 2025 - Day 3)

### Velocity-Based Progress Tracking

**Core SQL:1999 Compliance**: ~35% complete in 3 days

**Demonstrated Velocity**:
- **Days 1-3** (Oct 25-27): 35% complete ‚Üí **Phase 3 Complete!** üéâ
- **Projected completion**: ~7 days total from start (on track!)
- **Target date**: October 31 - November 1, 2025

### Progress Breakdown by Category

| Category | Progress | Completed | Status |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Data Types | 40% (5/13) | INTEGER, FLOAT, VARCHAR, BOOLEAN, NULL | üü° In Progress |
| DML Operations | 40% (4/10) | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | üü° In Progress |
| Predicates | 100% | =, <>, <, >, <=, >=, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, EXISTS, IS NULL, quantified, ALL, ANY, SOME | ‚úÖ Complete |
| JOINs | 100% (5/5) | INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Subqueries | 100% | Scalar, table, correlated, IN with subquery | ‚úÖ Complete |
| CTEs | 100% | WITH clause, multiple CTEs, CTE chaining | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Set Operations | 100% | UNION [ALL], INTERSECT [ALL], EXCEPT [ALL] | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Aggregates | 86% (6/7) | COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, + DISTINCT | üü¢ Advanced |
| Built-in Functions | 40% | UPPER, LOWER, SUBSTRING, TRIM, CHAR_LENGTH, CASE, COALESCE, NULLIF, CAST | üü° In Progress |
| DDL | 10% (1/10) | CREATE TABLE | üî¥ Early |
| Constraints | 0% (0/5) | None | ‚è≥ Days 4-5 |
| Transactions | 0% (0/4) | None | ‚è≥ Days 4-5 |
| ODBC Driver | 0% | None | üî¥ Days 6-7 |
| JDBC Driver | 0% | None | üî¥ Days 6-7 |

### Why 1 Week Is Achievable

**Data-Driven Projection**:
- 2 days elapsed ‚Üí 25-30% complete
- Average velocity: **12.5-15% per day**
- 2 √∑ 0.275 = **7.3 days total projected**
- Remaining: **~5 days**

**AI-Powered Development Advantages**:
- Parallel feature implementation
- Instant boilerplate generation
- Rapid test creation and iteration
- Well-defined SQL:1999 specification (no ambiguity)

**What Makes This Different**:
- Traditional estimates assume human-paced development
- AI assistance enables 5-10x faster iteration
- Clear specifications (SQL:1999 standard is precise)
- Strong foundation already built (parser, executor, storage)

### What Works Today (Days 1-3 Achievements)

## üéØ Design Principles

### What Makes This Project Unique

**1. Standards-First Approach**
- SQL:1999 specification is the source of truth
- NIST test suite validation
- No shortcuts or "close enough" implementations

**2. Educational Value**
- Comprehensive documentation of decisions
- TDD approach with 477 tests
- Clear, readable Rust code
- Interactive web demo for learning

**3. Pragmatic Simplifications**
- In-memory only (no persistence)
- No performance requirements
- Single-threaded execution
- Focus: correctness over speed

**4. Research Goal**
- Target unprecedented FULL SQL:1999 compliance
- Document the journey and challenges
- Contribute to SQL implementation knowledge

---

## üß™ Test-Driven Development

We build using **strict TDD** (Red-Green-Refactor):

```rust
// 1. RED: Write failing test first
#[test]
fn test_between_predicate() {
    let sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65";
    let result = parser::parse(sql);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

// 2. GREEN: Implement just enough to pass
// 3. REFACTOR: Clean up while tests stay green
```

**Benefits Observed**:
- ‚úÖ 477 tests passing (100% success rate)
- ‚úÖ 84% code coverage
- ‚úÖ Zero warnings (compiler + clippy)
- ‚úÖ Faster development (less debugging)
- ‚úÖ Safe refactoring
- ‚úÖ Tests as living documentation
