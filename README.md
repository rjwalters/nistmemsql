## üéØ Project Vision

Build a **FULL SQL:1999 compliant** database from scratch, designed for NIST conformance testing. This is a research and educational project targeting complete standard compliance‚Äîsomething no production database has achieved.

### Two-Phase Strategy

**Phase 1: Core SQL:1999 Compliance** (Current Focus - AI Speed Run)
- Implement ~169 mandatory Core features
- Timeline: **~1-2 weeks** from start (Oct 25, 2025)
- Enables NIST Core testing
- Provides solid foundation

**Phase 2: FULL SQL:1999 Compliance** (Ultimate Goal)
- Implement all mandatory + optional features (400+)
- Timeline: A larger effort, but not years
- Unprecedented achievement
- Aligns with [upstream posix4e/nistmemsql](https://github.com/posix4e/nistmemsql) vision

**Note**: PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server implement Core + selective optional features. This is an AI-powered "speed run" to demonstrate rapid standards compliance.

## üí≠ Backstory: The Inflection Point Challenge

### The Philosophical Debate

[@rjwalters](https://github.com/rjwalters) has been arguing that we've crossed the **inflection point** for terminal-based coding agents‚Äîthat AI assistants like Claude Code are now capable of implementing complex software designs end-to-end, given appropriate guidance. See [Working with AI](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom/blob/main/docs/philosophy/working-with-ai.md) and [Where Are All the Projects?](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom/blob/main/docs/philosophy/where-are-all-the-projects.md) for the full philosophy.

[@posix4e](https://github.com/posix4e) was skeptical. The objections centered on **context window limitations**‚Äîthe belief that current LLMs can't handle truly complex or large projects that require maintaining state across thousands of implementation decisions.

### The Challenge

Rather than endless debate, a challenge was proposed: **"Implement a NIST-compatible SQL database from scratch."**

This isn't a toy project. A fully SQL:1999 compliant database is a **massive undertaking**:
- LLM estimates suggest a solo human developer might need **3-5 years** for FULL spec compliance
- No production database has achieved complete SQL:1999 compliance
- It's complex enough to be a legitimate test of AI capabilities
- It's tedious enough that humans typically give up

**@rjwalters' Position**: Claude Code, with appropriate guidance and the [Loom orchestration framework](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom), can implement the **Core SQL:1999 spec in less than two weeks**‚Äîorders of magnitude faster and cheaper than a human expert.

### The Experiment

This repository is that experiment, documented in real-time:

**Current Results** (4 days in):
- ‚úÖ 50% of Core SQL:1999 complete
- ‚úÖ 700+ tests passing (100%)
- ‚úÖ Complete query engine with JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, aggregates, window functions
- ‚úÖ 75+ built-in functions (string, date/time, math)
- ‚úÖ Live web demo running in browser via WASM
- üìà Ahead of schedule - **8-10 day Core completion projected**

**The Open Question**: Can Claude Code achieve **FULL SQL:1999 compliance**‚Äîsomething no database has ever accomplished? That would require months more work, implementing ~400+ features including procedural SQL, triggers, advanced types, and the information schema.

**The Certain Thing**: Writing a SQL database is **incredibly tedious**. A human developer would burn out after a few weeks of implementing string padding rules and three-valued logic edge cases. Claude won't. It'll keep trying, keep testing, keep iterating‚Äîhowever long it takes.

### Why This Matters

This isn't just about databases. It's about understanding what's now possible with AI-assisted development:
- Can LLMs handle multi-month, complex engineering projects?
- Do context windows truly limit real-world capability?
- What's the productivity multiplier with proper tooling (Loom)?
- Where is the actual inflection point for AI-powered development?

**We're documenting everything**‚Äîthe successes, the failures, the weird edge cases where Claude hallucinates test assertions, the surprising moments where it refactors better than expected. Win or lose, the data will be public.

**Follow along**: This README updates in real-time as the experiment progresses. Place your bets.

## üìä Current Status (October 28, 2025 - Day 4)

### Velocity-Based Progress Tracking

**Core SQL:1999 Compliance**: ~50% complete in 4 days

**Demonstrated Velocity**:
- **Days 1-4** (Oct 25-28): 50% complete ‚Üí **Ahead of schedule!** üöÄ
- **Projected completion**: ~8-10 days total from start
- **Target date**: November 2-4, 2025

### Progress Breakdown by Category

| Category | Progress | Completed | Status |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Data Types | 100% (14/13) | INTEGER, SMALLINT, BIGINT, FLOAT, REAL, DOUBLE, VARCHAR, CHAR, BOOLEAN, DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, NUMERIC, INTERVAL | ‚úÖ Complete |
| DML Operations | 50% (5/10) | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP TABLE | üü¢ Advanced |
| Predicates | 100% | =, <>, <, >, <=, >=, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, EXISTS, IS NULL, quantified, ALL, ANY, SOME | ‚úÖ Complete |
| JOINs | 100% (5/5) | INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Subqueries | 100% | Scalar, table, correlated, IN with subquery | ‚úÖ Complete |
| CTEs | 100% | WITH clause, multiple CTEs, CTE chaining, RECURSIVE keyword | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Set Operations | 100% | UNION [ALL], INTERSECT [ALL], EXCEPT [ALL] | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Aggregates | 100% (7/7) | COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, + DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING | ‚úÖ Complete |

| Transactions | 0% (0/4) | None | ‚è≥ Days 5-6 |
| ODBC Driver | 0% | None | üî¥ Days 7-8 |
| JDBC Driver | 0% | None | üî¥ Days 7-8 |

### Why 8-10 Days Is Achievable

**Data-Driven Projection**:
- 4 days elapsed ‚Üí 50% complete
- Average velocity: **~12.5% per day**
- 4 √∑ 0.50 = **~8 days total projected**
- Remaining: **~4 days**

**AI-Powered Development Advantages**:
- Parallel feature implementation via Loom orchestration
- Instant boilerplate generation
- Rapid test creation and iteration
- Well-defined SQL:1999 specification (no ambiguity)

**What Makes This Different**:
- Traditional estimates assume human-paced development
- AI assistance with Loom orchestration enables 5-10x faster iteration
- Clear specifications (SQL:1999 standard is precise)
- Strong foundation already built (parser, executor, storage)

## üéØ Design Principles

### What Makes This Project Unique

**1. Standards-First Approach**
- SQL:1999 specification is the source of truth
- NIST test suite validation
- No shortcuts or "close enough" implementations

**2. Educational Value**
- Comprehensive documentation of decisions
- TDD approach with 477 tests
- Clear, readable Rust code
- Interactive web demo for learning

**3. Pragmatic Simplifications**
- In-memory only (no persistence)
- No performance requirements
- Single-threaded execution
- Focus: correctness over speed

**4. Research Goal**
- Target unprecedented FULL SQL:1999 compliance
- Document the journey and challenges
- Contribute to SQL implementation knowledge

---

## üß™ Test-Driven Development

We build using **strict TDD** (Red-Green-Refactor):

```rust
// 1. RED: Write failing test first
#[test]
fn test_between_predicate() {
    let sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65";
    let result = parser::parse(sql);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

// 2. GREEN: Implement just enough to pass
// 3. REFACTOR: Clean up while tests stay green
```

**Benefits Observed**:
- ‚úÖ 700+ tests passing (100% success rate)
- ‚úÖ 85% code coverage
- ‚úÖ Zero warnings (compiler + clippy)
- ‚úÖ Faster development (less debugging)
- ‚úÖ Safe refactoring
- ‚úÖ Tests as living documentation
- ‚úÖ Loom orchestration enables parallel development
