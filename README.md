## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a **FULL SQL:1999 compliant** database from scratch, designed for NIST conformance testing. This is a research and educational project targeting complete standard compliance—something no production database has achieved.

### Two-Phase Strategy

**Phase 1: Core SQL:1999 Compliance** (Current Focus - AI Speed Run)
- Implement ~169 mandatory Core features
- Timeline: **~1-2 weeks** from start (Oct 25, 2024)
- Enables NIST Core testing
- Provides solid foundation

**Phase 2: FULL SQL:1999 Compliance** (Ultimate Goal)
- Implement all mandatory + optional features (400+)
- Timeline: A larger effort, but not years
- Unprecedented achievement
- Aligns with [upstream posix4e/nistmemsql](https://github.com/posix4e/nistmemsql) vision

**Note**: PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server implement Core + selective optional features. This is an AI-powered "speed run" to demonstrate rapid standards compliance.

## 🤖 100% AI-Generated: The Vibe-Coded Database

**Does this README sound like it was written by AI? That's because it was.**

Every line of code, every test, every piece of documentation in this repository has been generated by AI agents using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and the [Loom orchestration framework](https://github.com/loomhq/loom). This is not AI-assisted development—this is **AI-primary development**.

**What we've built** (in ~1 week, Oct 25-31, 2024):
- 📊 **64,000+ lines** of production Rust code
- ✅ **2,000+ passing tests** with 86% coverage
- 🎯 **Near-complete SQL:1999 Core compliance** (see badge above)
- 🚀 **Full WASM compilation** with live browser demo
- 📝 **Complete documentation** (you're reading it)
- 🏗️ **90+ merged PRs** via AI Builder/Judge workflow
- 🔒 **Complete security model** with privilege enforcement

**The challenge**: Can AI build a NIST-compatible SQL database from scratch? The answer is becoming clear: **Yes, and faster than expected.**

This is "vibe coding" at scale—high-level intent translated directly into working, tested, standards-compliant software. No human wrote the Rust. No human wrote the tests. The AI did it all.

**See [SQL:1999 Conformance Report](https://rjwalters.github.io/nistmemsql/conformance.html) for detailed test results and remaining work.**

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
cargo coverage

# Run SQL:1999 conformance tests
cargo test --test sqltest_conformance -- --nocapture

# Run SQLLogicTest baseline verification
cargo test --test sqllogictest_basic

# Run comprehensive SQLLogicTest suite (623 files, takes hours)
cargo test --test sqllogictest_suite -- --nocapture
```

**Note**: The comprehensive SQLLogicTest suite contains ~5.9 million individual test cases across 623 files. Running the full suite takes several hours. Use the basic verification test for quick validation.

## 💭 Backstory: The Inflection Point Challenge

### The Philosophical Debate

[@rjwalters](https://github.com/rjwalters) has been arguing that we've crossed the **inflection point** for terminal-based coding agents—that AI assistants like Claude Code are now capable of implementing complex software designs end-to-end, given appropriate guidance. See [Working with AI](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom/blob/main/docs/philosophy/working-with-ai.md) and [Where Are All the Projects?](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom/blob/main/docs/philosophy/where-are-all-the-projects.md) for the full philosophy.

[@posix4e](https://github.com/posix4e) was skeptical. The objections centered on **context window limitations**—the belief that current LLMs can't handle truly complex or large projects that require maintaining state across thousands of implementation decisions.

### The Challenge

Rather than endless debate, a challenge was proposed: **"Implement a NIST-compatible SQL database from scratch."**

This isn't a toy project. A fully SQL:1999 compliant database is a **massive undertaking**:
- LLM estimates suggest a solo human developer might need **3-5 years** for FULL spec compliance
- No production database has achieved complete SQL:1999 compliance
- It's complex enough to be a legitimate test of AI capabilities
- It's tedious enough that humans typically give up

**@rjwalters' Position**: Claude Code, with appropriate guidance and the [Loom orchestration framework](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom), can implement the **Core SQL:1999 spec in less than two weeks**—orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than a human expert.

### The Experiment

This repository is that experiment, documented in real-time:

**Current Results** (As of latest test run):
- ✅ **Near-complete SQL:1999 conformance** (see badge for current %)
- ✅ **2,000+ unit/integration tests passing** (100%)
- ✅ Complete query engine with JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, aggregates, window functions
- ✅ Full transaction support with SAVEPOINT, all constraints enforced
- ✅ **Complete security model** with privilege enforcement on all operations
- ✅ 50+ built-in functions (string, date/time, math)
- ✅ Live web demo running in browser via WASM
- 📈 **Excellent conformance** - targeting near-100% compliance

**The Open Question**: Can Claude Code achieve **FULL SQL:1999 compliance**—something no database has ever accomplished? That would require months more work, implementing ~400+ features including procedural SQL, triggers, advanced types, and the information schema.

**The Certain Thing**: Writing a SQL database is **incredibly tedious**. A human developer would burn out after a few weeks of implementing string padding rules and three-valued logic edge cases. Claude won't. It'll keep trying, keep testing, keep iterating—however long it takes.

### Why This Matters

This isn't just about databases. It's about understanding what's now possible with AI-assisted development:
- Can LLMs handle multi-month, complex engineering projects?
- Do context windows truly limit real-world capability?
- What's the productivity multiplier with proper tooling (Loom)?
- Where is the actual inflection point for AI-powered development?

**We're documenting everything**—the successes, the failures, the weird edge cases where Claude hallucinates test assertions, the surprising moments where it refactors better than expected. Win or lose, the data will be public.

**Follow along**: This README updates in real-time as the experiment progresses. Place your bets.

cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice')")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, 'Bob')")

# Query data
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

## 🎯 Design Principles

### What Makes This Project Unique

**1. Standards-First Approach**
- SQL:1999 specification is the source of truth
- NIST test suite validation
- No shortcuts or "close enough" implementations

**2. Educational Value**
- Comprehensive documentation of decisions
- TDD approach with 477 tests
- Clear, readable Rust code
- Interactive web demo for learning

**3. Pragmatic Simplifications**
- In-memory only (no persistence)
- No performance requirements
- Single-threaded execution
- Focus: correctness over speed

**4. Research Goal**
- Target unprecedented FULL SQL:1999 compliance
- Document the journey and challenges
- Contribute to SQL implementation knowledge

---

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development

We build using **strict TDD** (Red-Green-Refactor):

```rust
// 1. RED: Write failing test first
#[test]
fn test_between_predicate() {
    let sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65";
    let result = parser::parse(sql);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

// 2. GREEN: Implement just enough to pass
// 3. REFACTOR: Clean up while tests stay green
```

**Benefits Observed**:
- ✅ 700+ tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ 85% code coverage
- ✅ Zero warnings (compiler + clippy)
- ✅ Faster development (less debugging)
- ✅ Safe refactoring
- ✅ Tests as living documentation
- ✅ Loom orchestration enables parallel development

**Current Focus**: Reaching 100% SQL:1999 Core conformance
- **Near-complete conformance** (see badge for current %)
- **Achievement**: Excellent foundation - core query engine, transactions, constraints, security model complete
- **Next Target**: Continue toward 100% compliance
- **Strategy**: Analyze remaining errors to identify high-impact fixes
- **Priority**: Data-driven approach based on failure patterns

**Ultimate Goal**: Complete SQL:1999 Core compliance, then pursue FULL compliance
