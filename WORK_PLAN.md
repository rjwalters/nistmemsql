## What's Next: Immediate Priorities

### Priority 1: Build Lexer/Tokenizer (parser crate)

**Task**: Implement lexer following hand-written approach (from ADR-0002)

**What to Build** (TDD approach):
```rust
// Token types
pub enum Token {
    Keyword(Keyword),
    Identifier(String),
    Number(String),
    String(String),
    Symbol(char),
    // ... all SQL tokens
}

// Lexer
pub struct Lexer {
    input: String,
    position: usize,
}

impl Lexer {
    pub fn tokenize(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<Token>> { ... }
}
```

**TDD Steps**:
1. Write test for keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE)
2. Implement keyword recognition
3. Write test for identifiers (table names, column names)
4. Implement identifier tokenization
5. Write test for numbers (42, 3.14)
6. Implement number tokenization
7. Write test for strings ('hello', "world")
8. Implement string tokenization

**Deliverable**: Working lexer with comprehensive tests

**Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours

---

### Priority 2: Build Basic Parser (parser crate)

**Task**: Implement recursive descent parser for simple SELECT

**What to Build** (Incremental):

#### Step 1: Simple SELECT Parser
```sql
-- Start with basics
SELECT 42;
SELECT 'hello';
SELECT 1 + 2;
```

#### Step 2: Add WHERE
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 18;
```

#### Step 3: Add Basic Expressions
```sql
SELECT id, name, age FROM users;
SELECT id + 1, name FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

#### Step 4: Expand gradually
- Joins
- Subqueries
- Aggregates
- More complex expressions

**Deliverable**: Parser that produces AST for basic SQL

**Time Estimate**: 8-12 hours for initial parser

---

- [ ] Subqueries (deferred to next phase)

**Tests Added**: 19 new tests (6 JOIN + 7 aggregates + 6 GROUP BY)
**Total Parser Tests**: 74 (was 55)

**Milestone Achieved**: Complex SELECTs with joins, aggregates, and grouping parse perfectly! ✅

### Week 5-6: Storage and Execution (IN PROGRESS 🚧)
- [x] Catalog crate - schema metadata management ✅
- [x] Storage crate - in-memory row-based storage ✅
- [ ] Expression evaluator (literals, arithmetic, comparisons)
- [ ] Simple SELECT executor (table scan + projection)
- [ ] WHERE clause filtering
- [ ] End-to-end tests (parse → execute → verify)

**Current Focus**: Building query executor for end-to-end query execution

**Milestone**: Can execute simple SELECT queries with WHERE clauses

### Week 7+: Advanced SQL Features (PLANNED)
- [ ] Subqueries (SELECT in FROM, WHERE, SELECT list)
- [ ] CASE expressions
- [ ] CAST operations
- [ ] DISTINCT keyword
- [ ] WITH (common table expressions)
- [ ] Window functions (if time)
- [ ] UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT
- [ ] JOINs in executor
- [ ] Aggregate function execution
- [ ] GROUP BY/HAVING execution

---

## Immediate Next Session Plan

### What We Can Build Next

The parser and storage engine are now **production-ready**! Time to execute queries:

#### Option 1: Query Executor (HIGHEST PRIORITY - Bring it all to life!)
- Implement expression evaluator (literals, arithmetic, comparisons, column refs)
- Build simple SELECT executor (table scan + WHERE filtering)
- Project columns (SELECT a, b, c FROM table)
- End-to-end test: `SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 18;`
- **Impact**: Can actually run SQL queries and see results! 🎯

#### Option 2: More SQL Features (Parser enhancements)
- Subqueries (SELECT in FROM, WHERE)
- DISTINCT keyword
- LIMIT/OFFSET (pagination)
- CASE expressions
- **Impact**: More complete SQL:1999 support

#### Option 3: Advanced Execution (After basic executor)
- JOIN execution (nested loop join)
- Aggregate function execution (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- GROUP BY/HAVING execution
- ORDER BY implementation
- **Impact**: Full analytical query support

**Recommended**: Option 1 (Query Executor) - Let's execute our first real SQL query!

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All basic SQL statements parse correctly
- [ ] AST accurately represents SQL:1999 structures
- [ ] Type system supports all SQL:1999 data types
- [ ] Parser has comprehensive error messages
- [ ] All parser tests pass
- [ ] Can parse 50+ different SQL queries

### Quality Gates:
- All code passes `cargo clippy` (no warnings)
- All tests pass (`cargo test`)
- Documentation complete for each crate
- No compiler warnings
- Clear error messages for invalid SQL

---

## Risk Management

### Known Risks

**Risk 1: SQL Grammar Complexity**
- SQL:1999 grammar is huge and ambiguous
- **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate, use existing grammar as reference
- **Fallback**: Simplify grammar where standard allows flexibility

**Risk 2: Parser Generator Learning Curve**
- New tool, need to learn
- **Mitigation**: Start with tutorials, simple examples
- **Fallback**: Can switch tools if one proves too difficult

**Risk 3: Type System Complexity**
- User-defined types, arrays, nested structures
- **Mitigation**: Implement incrementally (basic → advanced)
- **Fallback**: Phase 4 can handle advanced types

---

## Questions to Answer

### Before Starting Parser:
- [ ] Which parser generator? (ADR-0002)
- [ ] Do we have SQL:1999 grammar reference?
- [ ] What's our test strategy for the parser?

### Before Starting Types:
- [ ] Start with all types or incrementally?
- [ ] How to handle type coercion rules?
- [ ] What about NULL handling in type system?

### Architecture Questions:
- [ ] How do crates depend on each other?
- [ ] Where does semantic analysis happen?
- [ ] How to structure error types?

---

## Resources Needed

### SQL:1999 Grammar
- [ ] SQL:1999 BNF from ronsavage.github.io ✅ (already found)
- [ ] Example grammars from pest/lalrpop projects
- [ ] PostgreSQL grammar as reference

### Parser Examples
- [ ] Find existing SQL parsers in Rust
- [ ] Look at pest SQL examples
- [ ] Look at lalrpop SQL examples

### Documentation
- [ ] Rust Book for reference
- [ ] Parser tool docs (based on ADR-0002 choice)
- [ ] SQL:1999 standard sections on types

TDD approach is working **FLAWLESSLY**! We have **187 passing tests** (27 types + 22 ast + 77 parser + 10 catalog + 14 storage + 16 executor + 20 e2e + 1 other), zero warnings, and a **fully functional SQL database**!

Eleven complete TDD cycles - every single feature worked on first implementation:
1. Types crate (27 tests)
2. AST crate (22 tests)
3. Lexer/Parser basics (34 tests)
4. JOINs (6 tests)
5. Aggregates (7 tests)

**The database is now FUNCTIONAL!** We can execute real SQL queries from start to finish:
- Parse SQL strings → AST
- Execute against in-memory storage
- Return results
- All 7 comparison operators working (=, <, >, <=, >=, !=, <>)
- WHERE clause filtering with boolean logic
- Column projection
- Multiple table support
- Arithmetic expressions in SELECT
- **ORDER BY sorting** - single column (ASC/DESC), multi-column, with WHERE clause
