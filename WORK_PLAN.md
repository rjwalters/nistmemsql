## Technical Debt & Known Issues

1. **Executor JOIN Tests** - 4 failing tests for CROSS, FULL OUTER, RIGHT OUTER joins
   - Parser supports these JOIN types
   - Executor needs implementation updates
   - Priority: Medium (basic JOINs work)

2. **Test Coverage** - Currently 83.3%, target 90%+
   - Need more edge case testing
   - Integration test expansion
   - Priority: Low

3. **Documentation** - Some docs outdated
   - WORK_PLAN.md (this file) - NOW UPDATED âœ…
   - README.md - needs web demo section update
   - Priority: Medium

## Next Session Recommendations

### Option 1: Fix JOIN Test Failures (RECOMMENDED)
- Debug and fix 4 failing executor tests

## Risk Management

### Current Risks: LOW

**Previous risks mitigated**:
- âœ… Parser complexity - SOLVED (hand-written approach working perfectly)
- âœ… Type system complexity - SOLVED (incremental implementation successful)
- âœ… TDD learning curve - SOLVED (approach proven highly effective)
- âœ… Web demo complexity - SOLVED (modern tooling working well)

**Remaining minor risks**:
- **Correlated subquery complexity** - Medium complexity feature
  - Mitigation: Incremental implementation, comprehensive testing
- **WASM bundle size** - Browser performance concern
  - Mitigation: Issue #58 addresses optimization
