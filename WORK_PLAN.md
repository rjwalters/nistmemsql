# Work Plan: Roadmap to SQL:1999 Compliance

**Status**: Phase 4 In Progress - SQL:1999 Core Feature Implementation
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27
**Current Phase**: Implementing Core SQL:1999 mandatory features
**Ultimate Goal**: FULL SQL:1999 compliance (Core first, then optional features)
**Development Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ Compliance Strategy

### Phase 1: Core SQL:1999 Compliance (Current Focus)
**Timeline**: 10-14 months
**Goal**: Implement ~169 mandatory Core SQL:1999 features
**Why Core First**: Achievable milestone that enables NIST testing and provides solid foundation

### Phase 2: FULL SQL:1999 Compliance (Long-term Vision)
**Timeline**: 3-5 years total
**Goal**: Implement all mandatory + optional features (400+ features)
**Alignment**: Original posix4e/nistmemsql vision

**Note**: No production database has achieved FULL SQL:1999 compliance. PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server implement Core + selective optional features. We're targeting complete compliance as a long-term research goal.

- Row-level and statement-level
- OLD/NEW references
- Trigger conditions
- Cascading triggers

### Security & Privileges (~4-6 months)
- GRANT, REVOKE
- CREATE/DROP ROLE
- Role hierarchies
- WITH GRANT OPTION
- Schema-level privileges
- Table/column privileges
- Execute privileges

### Information Schema (~3 months)
- TABLES view
- COLUMNS view

**Estimated Total for FULL Compliance Beyond Core**: 52-72 months (4-6 years)

**Combined Timeline (Core + FULL)**: 62-86 months (5-7 years)

This aligns with the original posix4e/nistmemsql vision while acknowledging the realistic scope. Core compliance first provides an achievable milestone and enables NIST testing, while FULL compliance remains the ultimate research goal.
