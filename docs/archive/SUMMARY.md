# Archive Summary

This directory contains historical documents, completed work, and documentation that has been superseded by newer approaches. These files are preserved for historical context and reference.

## 📚 Historical Documents

## 🎯 Why These Documents Are Archived

These documents are archived because:
- **Completed work**: Features fully implemented (e.g., subqueries)
- **Superseded approaches**: Replaced by better strategies documented elsewhere
- **Historical context**: Valuable for understanding project evolution but not current development
- **Reference material**: Useful for understanding decisions but not active guidance

## 📖 Where to Find Current Information

**Active planning** → See [../WORK_PLAN.md](../WORK_PLAN.md)

**Current testing** → See [../TESTING_STRATEGY.md](../TESTING_STRATEGY.md)

**Architectural decisions** → See [../decisions/](../decisions/)

**Recent lessons** → See [../lessons/](../lessons/)

**Conformance status** → See [../SQL1999_CONFORMANCE.md](../SQL1999_CONFORMANCE.md)

## 💡 Using Archived Documents

These documents remain valuable for:
- Understanding historical context and decision evolution
- Learning from past approaches and what changed
- Reference implementation details for completed features
- Tracing the project's development journey

**Note**: Information in archived documents may be outdated. Always cross-reference with current documentation in parent directories.
