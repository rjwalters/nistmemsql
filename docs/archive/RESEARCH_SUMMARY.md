# Research Summary and Critical Findings

## Executive Summary

After thorough research and upstream clarification, we have a complete understanding of the project requirements. This document summarizes key findings and highlights critical challenges.

## Requirements Clarification (from GitHub Issues)

All questions posed to the upstream maintainer have been answered:

| Issue | Question | Answer | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| #1 | SQL Standard Version? | **SQL:1999** | 1999 features required (recursion, triggers, UDTs) |
| #2 | Compliance Level? | **FULL** | All core + all optional features |
| #3 | Programming Language? | **No preference** | We choose (recommend Rust) |
| #4 | ODBC/JDBC Scope? | **Tests must run through both** | Must implement both protocols |
| #5 | Persistence? | Not specified | Assume in-memory (with ACID for transactions) |
| #6 | Test Suite? | NIST compat tests | See critical finding below |
| #7 | Priorities? | Not specified | Recommend correctness-first |

## Critical Finding: NIST Test Suite Discrepancy

**MAJOR ISSUE DISCOVERED**:

The requirement states "full NIST Compat tests" but research reveals:

1. **NIST SQL Test Suite Version 6.0 only covers SQL-92**
   - Tests Entry, Transitional, and Intermediate SQL-92
   - Does NOT include SQL:1999 features
   - NIST SQL Testing Service has been terminated (obsolete)
   - May no longer be available for download

2. **No official NIST test suite exists for SQL:1999**
   - SQL:1999 was published in 1999
   - NIST stopped SQL testing before SQL:1999
   - No authoritative "NIST SQL:1999 conformance tests"

3. **Interpretation Required**
   - Either: Extend SQL-92 NIST tests with SQL:1999 additions
   - Or: Build custom "NIST-compatible" SQL:1999 test suite
   - Or: Use industry-standard alternatives (sqllogictest) + custom tests

**Recommendation**: Open GitHub issue asking for clarification on test suite interpretation.

## Scope Assessment

### What "FULL SQL:1999 Compliance" Means

SQL:1999 introduced a new conformance model:
- **Core SQL**: ~169 mandatory features (minimum conformance)
- **Optional Features**: Dozens of feature packages (triggers, procedures, UDTs, arrays, etc.)
- **FULL Compliance**: Core + ALL optional features

### Comparison to Real Databases

No major commercial database claims FULL compliance with any SQL standard:

- **PostgreSQL 16**: ~180 of 179 SQL:2016 Core features (exceeds Core, but not all optional)
- **Oracle**: High compliance, many extensions, but not 100% of any standard
- **SQL Server**: High compliance with proprietary additions
- **MySQL**: Improving, but significant gaps remain

**Reality**: Building a FULL SQL:1999 compliant database is an unprecedented achievement that no existing system has accomplished.

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Parser Complexity

- Context-sensitive parsing required
- Error recovery and reporting

### 2. Query Optimization
- Cost-based optimization is deep research area
- Join ordering, predicate pushdown
- Subquery optimization

### 3. Correctness of Execution
- Edge cases in NULL handling
- Three-valued logic (TRUE/FALSE/UNKNOWN)
- Aggregation with grouping
- Outer join semantics

### 4. Transaction Semantics
- ACID properties without disk persistence
- Isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable)
- Deadlock detection

### 5. User-Defined Types
- Type hierarchies and inheritance
- Method invocation on types
- Type checking with subtypes

### 6. Triggers and Procedures
- SQL/PSM language implementation
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Variable scoping
- Recursion in procedures

### 7. ODBC/JDBC Protocols
- Complex C API for ODBC
- State machines for connection/statement lifecycle
- Result set handling with scrollable cursors
- Parameter binding

### 8. Testing at Scale
- No official SQL:1999 test suite
- Must create comprehensive tests
- Dual-protocol testing (ODBC and JDBC)
- Continuous integration

2. **PostgreSQL Documentation**: Excellent SQL reference
3. **Database research papers**: Query optimization, transaction processing

## Recommended Technology Stack

Based on requirements and research:

### Primary Language: **Rust**

**Justification**:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Excellent performance (C/C++ level)
- Modern tooling and ecosystem
- Growing database ecosystem (TiKV, Databend, etc.)
- Good ODBC/JDBC FFI support
- Strong type system helps with correctness

**Alternatives**:
- C++: More complex, no memory safety guarantees
- Java: Easier JDBC, but GC overhead and slower
- Go: Good concurrency, but GC and not typical for databases

### Parser: **Parser Generator**

**Options**:
- **pest** (Rust): PEG parser, good for complex grammars
- **LALRPOP** (Rust): LR parser generator
- **nom** (Rust): Parser combinator library
- **ANTLR** (Multi-language): Industry standard, generates Rust code

**Recommendation**: Start with ANTLR for SQL:1999 grammar, as SQL grammars exist for ANTLR.

### Testing: **Hybrid Approach**

1. **sqllogictest-rs**: Baseline testing (7M+ tests)
2. **Custom SQL:1999 suite**: Feature-by-feature compliance
3. **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation
