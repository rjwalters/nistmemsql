  - Consolidated view of major lessons from the project
  - Key insights from SQL:1999 compliance work
  - What worked well and what didn't
  - Recommendations for future work

- **[TDD_APPROACH.md](TDD_APPROACH.md)** - **Test-Driven Development Lessons**
  - Exceptional success with Red-Green-Refactor cycle
  - How TDD improved code quality and design
  - Specific examples from types, parser, and executor crates
  - Benefits: 86% coverage, faster development, safe refactoring

  - Week-by-week development journal
  - What was accomplished each week
  - Blockers encountered
  - Velocity and progress observations

## 💡 Key Themes

### What Worked Well
- ✅ **Test-Driven Development** - Exceptional success with TDD approach
- ✅ **Loom Orchestration** - AI agents working in parallel accelerated development
- ✅ **Incremental Approach** - Building features step-by-step with tests
- ✅ **Documentation** - Capturing decisions and lessons in real-time

### Common Challenges
- ⚠️ **SQL:1999 Complexity** - Standard is massive and has many edge cases
- ⚠️ **Three-Valued Logic** - NULL handling throughout the codebase
- ⚠️ **Parser Ambiguity** - SQL grammar has context-sensitive rules
- ⚠️ **Test Coverage** - Finding comprehensive test suites for conformance

### Surprising Discoveries
- 💡 **AI Development Speed** - Much faster than expected for complex features
- 💡 **TDD Acceleration** - Tests first actually speeds up development
- 💡 **Rust Benefits** - Type system catches many SQL semantic errors early
- 💡 **Standards Gaps** - Even production databases don't fully implement SQL:1999

## 📝 Contributing Lessons

When you encounter a challenge or learn something valuable:
1. Document it while it's fresh in your mind
2. Add context: what, when, why, how
3. Include the solution or workaround
4. Update the appropriate document (CHALLENGES, GOTCHAS, or WEEKLY)
5. Cross-reference related code and issues
