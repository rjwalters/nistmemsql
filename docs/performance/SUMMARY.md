## 🎯 Performance Philosophy

**Current Focus**: Correctness over performance
- SQL:1999 compliance is priority #1
- Performance is important but secondary
- Avoid premature optimization
- Measure before optimizing

**Phase 2 Achievements** (Nov 2025):
- ✅ Hash join implementation: **260x speedup** on large joins
- ✅ Expression optimization: **50% memory reduction**
- ✅ COUNT(*) optimization: Near-constant time
- ✅ Foreign key scan skipping when no FKs exist

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Current Performance (Post Phase 2 Optimizations)
- **Simple queries** - Microsecond latency
- **Joins** - 260x faster with hash join (vs nested loop)
- **Aggregates** - COUNT(*) optimized, other aggregates linear
- **Inserts/Updates** - With constraint checking overhead
- **Memory usage** - 50% reduction through expression optimization

### Comparison Baseline
- MySQL (in-memory): 10-100x faster on most operations
- SQLite: 5-50x faster on most operations
- **But**: Neither achieves 100% SQL:1999 Core compliance

## 🔍 Using Performance Documentation

**Need to benchmark?** → Start with BENCHMARK_STRATEGY.md for methodology

**Want to optimize?** → Check OPTIMIZATION.md for proven techniques and Phase 2 results

**Profiling queries?** → Use PROFILING_GUIDE.md for profiling tools setup

**Analyzing results?** → Review PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md for detailed breakdowns

**Python overhead?** → See PYO3_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md for Python-specific analysis

## 🛠️ Performance Tools

**Built-in Profiling**:
```python
import VibeSQL
VibeSQL.enable_profiling()  # Prints detailed timing
# Run queries...
VibeSQL.disable_profiling()
```

**Benchmarking**:
```bash
# Run benchmark suite
./scripts/run_benchmarks.sh

# Compare with MySQL/SQLite
python benchmarks/compare_databases.py
```

**Rust Profiling**:
```bash
cargo build --release --features profiling
# Profiling output in stderr
```
